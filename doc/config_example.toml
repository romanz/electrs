# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY - COPY IT FIRST!
# If you edit this, you will cry a lot during update and will not want to live anymore!

# This is an EXAMPLE of how configuration file should look like.
# Do NOT blindly copy this and expect it to work for you!
# If you don't know what you're doing consider using automated setup or ask an experienced friend.

# This example contains only the most important settings.
# See docs or electrs man page for advanced settings.

# File where bitcoind stores the cookie, usually file .cookie in its datadir

# How to broadcast transactions.
# - "rpc" : use bitcoind to broadcast the TX directly
# - "pushtx-clear" : send the transaction to random bitcoin peers resolved from DNS seeds directly over clearnet
#                    (bad for privacy, don't use this unless you know what you're doing)
# - "pushtx-tor" : send the transaction to random bitcoin peers resolved from DNS seeds over a TOR proxy
# - "script" : pass the hex-encoded transaction to a script (specified by tx_broadcast_script)
tx_broadcast_method = "rpc"

# A script which is invoked with a hex-encoded transaction as the sole positional argument. Should exit
# with a zero status if the broadcast was successful.
