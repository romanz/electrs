# How to broadcast transactions.
# - "rpc" : use bitcoind to broadcast the TX directly
# - "pushtx-clear" : send the transaction to random bitcoin peers resolved from DNS seeds directly over clearnet
# - "pushtx-tor" : send the transaction to random bitcoin peers resolved from DNS seeds over a TOR proxy
# - "script" : pass the hex-encoded transaction to a script (specified by tx_broadcast_script)
tx_broadcast_method = "rpc"

# A script which is invoked with a hex-encoded transaction as the sole positional argument. Should exit
# with a zero status if the broadcast was successful.
